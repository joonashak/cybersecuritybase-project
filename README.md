> **This software intentionally includes numerous security vulnerabilities. 
Do not use this code unless you know what you are doing. You have been warned.**

This is my course project for a cybersecurity course at the University of Helsinki. 
The assignment was to make a web application that includes at least six vulnerabilities
on the [OWASP Top 10 list](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10-2017_Top_10). The 
course materials are available [here](https://cybersecuritybase.github.io/).

## Status

This code is functional and fulfills the assignment criteria, but is not pretty.
There are some wholly unnecessary files left over and the code could do with a
major refactoring. And, of course, as per the nature of the assignment, it includes
a lot of very bad business logic :)
